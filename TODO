Override __builtin__.int to provide similar functionality as symint to prevent
any changes at all necessary to Zoobar application?

Avoid double-trying inputs (KLEE inspired)

try/catch around app.run to check assertions never fail

symeval => symbuiltin
  - symint => int

Can we somehow detect available URLs, methods, and form fields?
This would make it *way* easier to test applications.
